## 🔑 Core Functionalities  

### 1. User Management  
- *User Registration*  
  - Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.  
  - Secure authentication using *JSON Web Tokens (JWT)*.  

- *User Login and Authentication*  
  - Implement login via email and password.  
  - Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).  

- *Profile Management*  
  - Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact information, and preferences.  

### 2. Property Listings Management  
- *Add Listings*  
  - Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.  

- *Edit/Delete Listings*  
  - Hosts can update or remove their property listings.  

### 3. Search and Filtering  
- Implement search functionality to allow users to find properties by:  
  - Location  
  - Price range  
  - Number of guests  
  - Amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)  
- Include pagination for large datasets.  

### 4. Booking Management  
- *Booking Creation*  
  - Guests can book properties for specified dates.  
  - Prevent double bookings using date validation.  

- *Booking Cancellation*  
  - Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.  

- *Booking Status*  
  - Track statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.  

### 5. Payment Integration  
- Implement secure payment gateways to handle:  
  - Upfront payments by guests.  
  - Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.  
- Include support for multiple currencies.  

### 6. Reviews and Ratings  
- Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties.  
- Hosts can respond to reviews.  
- Ensure reviews are linked to specific bookings to prevent abuse.  

### 7. Notifications System  
- Implement email and in-app notifications for:  
  - Booking confirmations  
  - Cancellations  
  - Payment updates  

### 8. Admin Dashboard  
- Create an admin interface for monitoring and managing:  
  - Users  
  - Listings  
  - Bookings  
  - Payments

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements  

### 1. Database Management  
- Use a relational database such as *PostgreSQL* or *MySQL*.  
- Required tables:  
  - Users (guests and hosts)  
  - Properties  
  - Bookings  
  - Reviews  
  - Payments  

### 2. API Development  
- Use *RESTful APIs* to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.  
- Include proper HTTP methods and status codes for:  
  - GET (retrieve data)  
  - POST (create data)  
  - PUT/PATCH (update data)  
  - DELETE (remove data)  
- Use *GraphQL* for complex data fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).  

### 3. Authentication and Authorization  
- Use *JWT* for secure user sessions.  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions for:  
  - Guests  
  - Hosts  
  - Admins  

### 4. File Storage  
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as *AWS S3* or *Cloudinary*.  

### 5. Third-Party Services  
- Use email services like *SendGrid* or *Mailgun* for email notifications.  

### 6. Error Handling and Logging  
- Implement global error handling for APIs.

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements  

### 1. Scalability  
- Use a modular architecture to ensure the app scales easily as traffic increases.  
- Enable horizontal scaling using load balancers.  

### 2. Security  
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using encryption.  
- Implement firewalls and rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.  

### 3. Performance Optimization  
- Use caching tools like *Redis* to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).  
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.  

### 4. Testing  
- Implement unit and integration tests using frameworks like *pytest*.  
- Include automated API testing to ensure endpoints function as expected.
